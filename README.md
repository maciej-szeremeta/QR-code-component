## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During the project, I learned how to create a hierarchy of first and second level headings.

```html
<h1 class="title">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">
  Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the
  next level
</h2>
```

I also learned how to use variables in CSS.

```css
:root {
  --whiteColor: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
.container {
  background-color: var(--whiteColor);
}
```

### Continued development

In the next tasks I will focus on the use of semantic tags in html.

### Useful resources

- [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This helped me understand how css variables work.
